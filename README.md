# Password-Generator-Memorable-Random-w-Time-Stamps
2 simple password generators focused using random package to create both a memorable, and random generation. Then later both given time-stamps upon generation, and then randomed into either 1000 times/and saves into a batch.

## a) Purpose of the Program(s):

    The purpose of this program was to create 2 password generators one of each memorable, and random, then generate time-stamps for when each password was generated, then generate (at random) between the 2 generations into 1000 passwords that are then batched saved. Also as a class assignment to better understand how the packages (string, timne, random, or math) could have been used into such applications.

## b) Input:

    The program takes the following inputs:
        Path to a '.txt' file containing 100000 noun words for the memorable generator.
        #IVs and EVs for each stat provided as dictionaries.
        #Pokemon species, level, and nature.

## c) Expected Output:

    #The program prints the details of the Pokemon, including its species, level, nature, and calculated stats for each stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed).

## d) Type of Execution:

    The program involves the following types of execution:

        #Sequential Execution: The code is executed in a linear order from top to bottom.
        #Reusable Execution: Functions are used for modular and reusable code blocks.

## e) Possible Improvements:

    The program could be improved by:
        Rathar than creating multiple function for the generators and then for the time-stamp parts, to incoroprate such things into one each.
    Another improvement is adjusting the random time-stamp for generating it 2 times rather than once (simple fix).
    Later down the line include the security function to supporth the strength and quality of the random generated passowords/what the passwords should advoid using.
